Hello! Welcome to our blog, which will detail our progress through our midterm project for the class DATA 2040 at Brown University. The project is the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19) to classify handwritten graphemes of the Bengali language. As explained on the competition homepage, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a written language. Bengali has 18 accents (or diacritics)  that can be added to its 49 letters. The combination of diacritic and letter makes up a grapheme. Therefore, Bengali has many more graphemes than English does, and the task of identifying and classifying handwritten Bengali graphemes is more complicated than in English.

Like many in the class, we have started with [this notebook,](https://www.kaggle.com/kaushal2896/bengali-graphemes-starter-eda-multi-output-cnn) which was suggested to us by our TA.
